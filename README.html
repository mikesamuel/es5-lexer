<title>ES5 Lexer</title>
<h1>ES5 Lexer</h1>
A lexical scanner for EcmaScript 5 that is as correct as one can be
(given the ambiguity between regular expressions and semicolons)
and produces a token stream that will be treated as equivalent by
any valid EcmaScript parser that parses the output.

<p>
This is meant to efficiently allow token level transformations
of valid EcmaScript 5 programs from untrusted sources that will have
same meaning as that assumed by the transformer when parsed by a full
EcmaScript interpreter.  For this to hold, the output token stream
must not contain any ambiguity.
